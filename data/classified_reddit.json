Netflix added the first two seasons to the service and was seemingly popular with the fans.  I’d rather see Netflix produce a third and possibly fourth season of the series we already love and want instead of starting over from scratch.\n",

    "selftext": "What follows is an email I attempted to send Netflix ... I logged in and chatted with them and the employee gave me a bad \"support\" email ... so I'm posting here for all to enjoy.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nHi, I'm not just a long-time customer (under my wife's email), I'm a computer programmer and UI specialist who's been programming on the web since 1995. The new UI changes you've made have some major problems.\n\n1. I have lots of items in the \"My List\" queue ... more than 50+. When I want to find something to watch now, I have no choice but to cycle through them ONE AT A TIME. In the past, the My List screen would show items 5-6 on a line, and I could hit the down arrow to quickly find what I wanted.\n   1. Now? There's no way I have the patience to find the end of the list by scrolling one-by-one to the right.\n   2. And once I do get there and decide what I'm in the mood for is at the beginning? I have to scroll one-by-one back through all the titles to the left? Sorry, but are you kidding me? Horrible design. You've made my user experience 10x worse.\n   3. The purpose of a new UI is to make the user's experience better/quicker with the ability to get the same (or new) job done with less clicks ... not a hundred more. You've backslid.\n2. I see what you were going with by splitting the My List screen into different rows, but I don't care about what I've already watched and what I've given thumbs up to. I've already seen those. I'm not 10 years old. I don't want to re-watch the same show/movie over and over. I want something new!!! **That's the entire reason for the My List queue.**\n   1. I usually choose what I want to watch by how much time I have and what mood I'm in ... so ... please make rows for the following:\n      1. \"My List TV Shows\"\n      2. \"My List Limited Series\"\n      3. \"My List Movies\"\n      4. \"My List Documentaries\"\n      5. etc.\n3. Also, when I'm scrolling down through shows, sometimes I just want to shut the tv up without reaching for a different remote. In the past, I'd skip down a row and slide to the left (to open the left menu) ... and that would \"pause\" all the constant trailers you bombard users with. Now ... I have no way to make the TV quiet with the remote I have in my hand ... and have to reach for another remote and find the button for Mute. Again, you've made my UI experience worse instead of better.\n\nThank you and please consider changes to the new UI. It's different and pretty and you have bigger boxes now for previews ... but it doesn't make me the User happier or help me get to my goal easier or quicker.  \n  \nInstead, it makes me impatient and not want to use the system. We're already subscribing, why would you want to make our experience worse?  \n  \nThank you for your time,  \nTim",

I fucking hate having to decide on a movie sometimes and always love when I find just what I'm looking for, and right now I'm not even going to attempt to find anything on this constricting layout that's just going to frustrate me and not provide literally the experience I'm paying for which is to REALX.

Georgia, as usual, was busy with her endless rants and chaotic sex life—constantly yapping without much depth.\n\nGinny looked sexy but stayed low-key throughout the season, which felt like a missed opportunity to develop her character. As for Paul, I couldn’t tolerate his forced masculinity and lack of real emotions. He seemed to be living in a bubble of idealism—felt bad for him at times, but not enough to care deeply.\n\nOn the brighter side, I loved Lynette’s character. She was a truly supportive mother and mother-in-law, probably one of the few genuine personalities this season. Meanwhile, Georgia’s so-called friends proved they’re not even loyal to each other, let alone to her. That dynamic felt hollow.\n\nOverall, compared to the previous seasons, this one gets a 6/10 from me. Wouldn’t recommend wasting time on it.\n",

    "title": "Department Q - question about Lyle - SPOILERS",
    "selftext": "I just finished Dept. Q and loved it!  I loved the writing/dialog, the characters, and the acting.   At first I thought Matthew Goode (Mr nice guy in Downton Abbey) was too 'soft' for this role as Carl, but he turned out great.  And of course, Rose and Ackram nailed it.   I do have a question, which came up already in a response to another thread, but I want to post it here as a new question so it gets more eyeballs.\n\nThe question relates to Lyle (Harry's brother, Ailsa's son), and Sam Haig. I THINK I've got it mostly figured out now, so most of this is how I think it happened, but there are still some questions.\n\nMerritt as a teenager was 'dating' Harry.  She didn't see much of Lyle (Harry's brother) - he just came over occasionally and 'interrupted' them. So I guess there's no reason to think she was that familiar with Lyle.  Meritt, Willliam, Lyle and Harry all live on the remote island of \"Mohr\" - an island that is now in decline due to the demise of the oil industry.\n\nHarry robbed Merritt's household, and during that event, Harry first struck William, but then we later discover that it was Lyle who severely beat William.   The local policeman pursued the event, but mistakenly thought Harry was the culprit and chased him to his death on the ferry.   Merritt came back to Mohr to attend Harry's funeral (and presumably met Lyle again there).\n\nMany years later (10, 15 years?) ('current time'), Lyle is obsessed with Merritt (as a romantic target? Sexual? - not clear).\n\nLyle has spent a lot of time in an institution, and while there, encountered 'Sam Haig', another inmate.  Sam was smart, and taught Lyle the art of deception / investigation / etc.  Now, Sam and Lyle are both out of captivity and working.  Sam was now an investigative journalist, doing well, driving a Porsche.  Lyle was struggling, working as a grunt on the local ferry.\n\nLyle decides he wants to get closer to Merritt. He knows she is a prosecutor (she's been on TV a few times so 'well known') and decides to impersonate Sam Haig, claiming to want to share information about corruption, etc with Merritt. Merritt finally meets him in a cafe, and 'warms' to him. She has no idea that it is Lyle and she's never met Sam Haig before so has no reason to doubt who he is.  So this is 'issue/question 1' - is it feasible that Merritt would not recognize Lyle 15 years later?  Lyle (as Sam) sleeps with Merritt.  'question 2' - is the real Sam Haig still alive at this point?\n\nIn addition to meeting with Merritt at the hotel on a regular basis for sex, Lyle is spying on her at her home - he's seen by William through the window one night.  So that explains how Lyle knows Merritt's movements.\n\nMerritt loses the case she's working on, and on the spur of the moment, decides to leave, with William, for Mohr on the ferry.\n\nLyle has followed Merritt onto the ferry (since he's been following her in general, this makes sense) and kidnaps her.  But - also on the ferry is Ailsa - Lyle's mum - who assists with the kidnapping.  How could Ailsa be on the ferry that day, given that it was a spur of the moment decision by Merritt to go that day?  Plot Hole?\n\nHaving kidnapped Merritt, Lyle then goes to kill the real Sam Haig at the 'cliff face' to tie up any loose ends, since he's been impersonating him.  Is this the correct timeline for Sam's death - AFTER the kidnap of Merritt?\n\nI don't normally pay this much attention to a show but there was something about the 'style' of this show that really connected with me, so I got really invested.  Now we have to wait to see if there's a second season!\n\nI thought the first 8 episodes were fantastic; I though E9 was a bit 'happy ever after', with the therapist showing up at Carl's house, soft music, etc but it was still great, and did set up for a second season - with the team well-funded and now respected.\n\nEdit reason - corrected 'spare' to 'spur' thanks to a poster for pointing it out!

    "selftext": "What follows is an email I attempted to send Netflix ... I logged in and chatted with them and the employee gave me a bad \"support\" email ... so I'm posting here for all to enjoy.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nHi, I'm not just a long-time customer (under my wife's email), I'm a computer programmer and UI specialist who's been programming on the web since 1995. The new UI changes you've made have some major problems.\n\n1. I have lots of items in the \"My List\" queue ... more than 50+. When I want to find something to watch now, I have no choice but to cycle through them ONE AT A TIME. In the past, the My List screen would show items 5-6 on a line, and I could hit the down arrow to quickly find what I wanted.\n   1. Now? There's no way I have the patience to find the end of the list by scrolling one-by-one to the right.\n   2. And once I do get there and decide what I'm in the mood for is at the beginning? I have to scroll one-by-one back through all the titles to the left? Sorry, but are you kidding me? Horrible design. You've made my user experience 10x worse.\n   3. The purpose of a new UI is to make the user's experience better/quicker with the ability to get the same (or new) job done with less clicks ... not a hundred more. You've backslid.\n2. I see what you were going with by splitting the My List screen into different rows, but I don't care about what I've already watched and what I've given thumbs up to. I've already seen those. I'm not 10 years old. I don't want to re-watch the same show/movie over and over. I want something new!!! **That's the entire reason for the My List queue.**\n   1. I usually choose what I want to watch by how much time I have and what mood I'm in ... so ... please make rows for the following:\n      1. \"My List TV Shows\"\n      2. \"My List Limited Series\"\n      3. \"My List Movies\"\n      4. \"My List Documentaries\"\n      5. etc.\n3. Also, when I'm scrolling down through shows, sometimes I just want to shut the tv up without reaching for a different remote. In the past, I'd skip down a row and slide to the left (to open the left menu) ... and that would \"pause\" all the constant trailers you bombard users with. Now ... I have no way to make the TV quiet with the remote I have in my hand ... and have to reach for another remote and find the button for Mute. Again, you've made my UI experience worse instead of better.\n\nThank you and please consider changes to the new UI. It's different and pretty and you have bigger boxes now for previews ... but it doesn't make me the User happier or help me get to my goal easier or quicker.  \n  \nInstead, it makes me impatient and not want to use the system. We're already subscribing, why would you want to make our experience worse?  \n  \nThank you for your time,  \nTim",

I fucking hate having to decide on a movie sometimes and always love when I find just what I'm looking for, and right now I'm not even going to attempt to find anything on this constricting layout that's just going to frustrate me and not provide literally the experience I'm paying for which is to REALX.

I'm now literally browsing to find something 3 titles at a time I have no comprehension of what I looked at a few clicks back.. no ability to see a group of titles at once and make that nerve wracking decision of should I watch John Wick again or Interstellar? I fucking hate having to decide on a movie sometimes and always love when I find just what I'm looking for, and right now I'm not even going to attempt to find anything on this constricting layout that's just going to frustrate me and not provide literally the experience I'm paying for which is to REALX. Whoever thought this was a good idea..I hope you're reading the feedback. At least give me an option to switch back to the old layout.

    "title": "Ginny&Georgia mental health problems discussion",
    "selftext": "It will be my thoughts about TRAITS not diagnosis!!!!\n\nI’ve got diagnosed with multiple mental health issues during my life, so I could relate with the carather’s problems (and maybe this is the reason why I am addicted with this show, it is so refreshing to see in an american show that they try to talk about mental health, even if it is just a series).\n\nGinny - early signs of BPD, panic disorder (fun fact: my symtomps also started when I was 12 w selfharm and panic attacks) the crashout to Marcus, when he tries to be caring, splitting to people, see everything black and white, and the abondentment issue, in some way Favourite person tendencies (Another fun fact at this age I had the same combo, my first love was also depressed, and it was the same dynamic). My fav part while rewatching (I try to be ironic a bit with the word of fav) when Ginny starts to feel owerhelmed by her emotions, instead of self harm, goes to Marcus and tries to have sex, she wants to distract, and in the third season with Wolfe also, I am very familiar with this feeling. And if we are at Wolfe careless sex, and Ginny also has tendencies to overuse anything is a big waving flag for BPD. Oh, and the realitionship with her mother is a big big trigger, Georgia always flips the narrative about herself, she flips the blame, she doesnt see Ginny’s feelings and also invalidates them, because he runaways from the feelings as from problems (Third fun fact, it was the same dynamic with my mom, still this day, but without murder and stuff, but I lived 6 places til I became 18, and she always lied to “save me and my little brother” this shit is traumatizing) And also, she likes to write - which means she feels a lot - most of the artistic persons dealing with mental health issues - it is just a note.\n\nMaxine - ADHD, quiet depression I was diagnosed with ADHD also, and in the third season they perfectly show how it feels like, with Maxine carachter, you want to be everywhere, you feel to much, you have so much thoughts, and in a sudden you you just get exhausted, and you freezed, get depressed, and you realize burnt every bridges around yourself - it can be some bipolar traits also, but that is not my first impression about Maxine. There’s the episode where she switch off and on the lights, lot of people said that it is OCD, yeah it can be, but I think ADHD sometimes includes OCD, and if you check the whole episode, it is def ADHD demonstraition.\n\nMarcus - depression Oh dear Marcus! I had two big love in my life, as I mentioned I had my “Marcus” when I was 17, and in that time honestly was so hard, because I didnt understood depression (discovered latley I had also that time, but not in that way in Marcus). It is hard to write about it because depression sometimes seems selfishness, but the other person is dying inside, I think the series tries to show this both side of this mental health problem. They say it out loud he has depression. Depression is something you see in the other eyes. You feel nothing but the darkness. You know you love someone, but sometimes you can’t feel it. Because you belive you are a bad person, you are acting like one, and push everyone away who loves you, because you are someone who unloveble. Til that they I couldn’t figured out how to handle it, the one who has it… It fckn sucks. And addicton I think it comes with it… or with any other mental health issue. You want to be normal. And you feel yourself normal with any addictive mind altering thing, until you not. When nothing is enough, and you find yourself in the rabbit hole - Marcus is great example for it.\n\nAbby - Eating disorder Abby is pro example of someone who deals with eating disorder, most likely bulimia, and in the world of social media it got so much worse in the last years, so much more teenager, starts to develope the traits, not because it became a fashion, as some stupid people says, it is because that looking good became more public than ever. But I also think, it is also about being traumatized in every age. Abby’s parents divorce can be a trigger, and also that she never feels to being fit anywhere.\n\nGeorgia - narcissistic traits, avoidant attachment style, cpstd, panic disorder The question is on every social media platform that Georgia is a good or bad mom. My opinion is def that she isn’t. I wouldn’t say that she has a narcissistic personality disorder, because she feels empathy, but she brings to the table lots of narcissistic traits. I mentioned at Ginny’s phrase. But you can relate with this character, because you know how much she got traumatized in the past, that’s why I think she have CPTSD, or actual PTSD, the memories are hunting her. But if we speak about her as a mom - she says that herself doing everything to their kids - which is true, but in one hand, she doesn’t do it that the way the kids needs, in the other hand she always wants to good in the others eyes. The list could goes on, I was crying in every Ginny&Georgia fighting scene, because my relived my childhood traumas…\n\nAustin - Autism I don’t know much autism, but I saw some example in my life, and Austin shows traits. Even Paul mentions in season 2 that maybe Austin has the similar issues that his little brother, which Georgia instantly denies, but it can be. And Paul’s brother clearly has autism.\n\nI didn’t wrote about panic disorder at the mom and daughter phrases, but it is also a hell, I’ve been there also, and now I developed a generlized anxiety disorder, and I think it hard to point out on the screen, maybe that Georgia is always in a flight or fight, and drinking about every day can be a working sign of it, but it is not clear.\n\nI think the author seen a lot in her life, because it is a well fckn well written script about mental health issues.\n\nLet me know if you noticed something else, I am corious what’ve may seen based upon your experience.\n\n(English is not my first language so sorry if it is not correct somewhere 🫶🏻)",

But then I thought about it, and it has a lot of depth. Maybe I‘m overthinking this, but this series shows us how easy it is to make the women the villain, how to frame them and how we do so easily believe it. Looking back, I just ignored the signs of Kiki being just nice without any agenda. The whole time I expected her behaviour to be calculating and cunning. I  jumped to the conclusion that she must be the bad guy as the show wanted us to believe at first. Even her behaviour contradicting this assumption didn’t sway me at first. But now I see the man who manipulates the viewers perspective. I so easily believed Peter when he talked about his alienation from his kids and it being kikis fault. But when she talked about how small the marriage made her and how horrible the kids were to her, it didn’t quite resonate as much. Frightening tbh, particularly because it still blinds you even when you are a feminist yourself. Maybe I’m interpreting too much, but if you look at it from a feminist perspective then it - amongst other things - shows us the sway of men’s opinion’s still and the smear campaign that always hits the women ten times harder. It shows us the dangers of dependency, especially as a woman. So, I kind of liked the show. I liked how it was over the top mostly and also sometimes even a bit satirical while dealing with heavier topics.  Let me know what you think and what your interpretation is",

I watched it yesterday and after taking a bit of time to think about the movie, I now ask myself what it was even about. In hindsight it just seems like someone wanted to make a movie about people killing each other and then decided to wrap this motive into a little bit of story. And many have done this before, like in John Wick. But in Havoc.. well I feel like they messed it up. During every major fighting scene I had the same questions: How is she still alive? How did they get here? Where has he been? And the same goes for the scenes afterwards. The fights take do long that I forget what the story is even about and after it ends I’m left wondering what just happened, what is the situation and who’s friend with who now? \n\nIn conclusion, I am not necessarily saying that it was a bad movie. I even think the choreography was quite alright. But it just seemed like it got a bit.. out of hand, I guess.. ",

    "selftext": "Hi - In the last 2 months I've bought 2 new LG TVs for my elderly parents. One for the living room and one for their bedroom. They have a communal TV aerial (no cable boxes or satellite used) and have historically struggled with the signal quality in their bedroom. \n\nThere's only 1 aerial socket in their home, so when they move in years ago my dad used a splitter for the 2 TVs (he drilled through the living room wall into the bedroom to run the cable).\n\nTheir living room picks up over 125 channels, but the bedroom only gets 45 at most, when I rescanned it got as few as 13. I rescanned several times in quick succession and got differing numbers of channels each time!\n\nI also rescanned the living room TV and checked that all the scan settings were identical to the bedroom TV, in case I wasn't comparing apples with apples.\n\nI'm wondering if it's worth buying a new coaxial cable and splitter (as they mustvbe 18 years old), or some kind of signal booster/indoor aerial?\n\nAlso, the picture quality in the living room is fine but poor in the bedroom.\n\nPlease help.

    "selftext": "“Outage? Not Our Problem,” Says Spectrum\n\nSpectrum's definition of an \"outage\" is a joke. You can lose service multiple times a day, for 10 minutes to nearly 2 hours at a time—and they’ll tell you it doesn't count. Why? Because unless it’s down for over 2 hours straight, they won't consider it a real outage. Imagine your internet crashing right before a Zoom meeting or your cable freezing mid-game—and being told, \"Sorry, it’s not long enough to matter.\"\n\nThis isn’t a rare issue—it’s daily life with Spectrum. Short, frequent interruptions destroy any hope of working from home, streaming a show, or even watching basic TV.\n\nOther common Spectrum frustrations:\n\nSky-high prices that keep creeping up without notice.\nTerrible customer support with robotic scripts and no real help.\nCable TV lag and glitches, with audio never matching the video.\nStreaming via their app? Glitchy, slow, and borderline unusable.\nInternet drops randomly, and there's never a straight answer.\nForced equipment rentals and fees you can’t escape.\nZero accountability—just blame-shifting and stonewalling.\nSpectrum doesn’t just provide bad service—they’ve built policies that justify bad service. If you have any other provider available, run to them. If Spectrum is your only option, prepare for constant headaches and the feeling of being completely ignored.",

It's unintuitive, intrusive, and actively hurts my eyes just trying to use.\n\nBecause of this, coupled with the price hike that happened recently, I am considering canceling and switching to the Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle. But I have a question for anyone that already has this bundle.\n\nIf you want say, Hulu and Max without ads, but are fine with Disney+ having ads, is there any way to manage that service specifically and change it to an ads on service, while keeping the other two as ad free, or are you locked in with ads or ad-free when you sign up (I'm sure you can change the whole plan for all of them to either ad supported or ad-free later of course)?\n\nI have no issue with ads on Disney+, as I probably won't watch too much on it to be bothered by the odd ad every now and then. But with both Hulu and Max, I know there are plenty on them that I absolutely WILL be watching consistently and would not like to get ads so often on.",

    "selftext": "Couple months ago I canceled my directTV after about ten+ years. I was paying 130 a month and the only channels I watched were the local channels for the news and the Dodgers game. I called around trying to find a place that installs roof top antennas but they are few and far between. I could only get places to install one but not sell me one. They said they had too many issues with the antennas not meeting people's expectations. I only need something that will allow me to watch the major networks out of LA, I don't really care about the other channels but if I get any extras that would be a nice bonus. I want to get a signal to at least 2 televions 4 would be optimal. Since I use to have direct tv can I use the same cables originally connected to my old satellite? Do I need any additional equipment besides the antenna? If I do hire someone to install the thing is there anything I should look out for? Does the thing need to be grounded? Are lightning strikes a concern? I am completely lost on this, any help would be appreciated, also can I get by with an indoor one or do I really need a rooftop one?  Oh and the stations I want to get are KCBS2, KNBC4, KTLA5, KABC7, KCAL9, KTTV11, KCOP13.\n",

    "selftext": "So I have recently been forced (Like many others the world over) to use the new horrendous layout for Netflix. I hate everything about it. It's unintuitive, intrusive, and actively hurts my eyes just trying to use.\n\nBecause of this, coupled with the price hike that happened recently, I am considering canceling and switching to the Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle. But I have a question for anyone that already has this bundle.\n\nIf you want say, Hulu and Max without ads, but are fine with Disney+ having ads, is there any way to manage that service specifically and change it to an ads on service, while keeping the other two as ad free, or are you locked in with ads or ad-free when you sign up (I'm sure you can change the whole plan for all of them to either ad supported or ad-free later of course)?\n\nI have no issue with ads on Disney+, as I probably won't watch too much on it to be bothered by the odd ad every now and then. But with both Hulu and Max, I know there are plenty on them that I absolutely WILL be watching consistently and would not like to get ads so often on.",

    "selftext": "Hi - In the last 2 months I've bought 2 new LG TVs for my elderly parents. One for the living room and one for their bedroom. They have a communal TV aerial (no cable boxes or satellite used) and have historically struggled with the signal quality in their bedroom. \n\nThere's only 1 aerial socket in their home, so when they move in years ago my dad used a splitter for the 2 TVs (he drilled through the living room wall into the bedroom to run the cable).\n\nTheir living room picks up over 125 channels, but the bedroom only gets 45 at most, when I rescanned it got as few as 13. I rescanned several times in quick succession and got differing numbers of channels each time!\n\nI also rescanned the living room TV and checked that all the scan settings were identical to the bedroom TV, in case I wasn't comparing apples with apples.\n\nI'm wondering if it's worth buying a new coaxial cable and splitter (as they mustvbe 18 years old), or some kind of signal booster/indoor aerial?\n\nAlso, the picture quality in the living room is fine but poor in the bedroom.\n\nPlease help.
